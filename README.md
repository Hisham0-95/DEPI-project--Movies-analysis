# DEPI Graduation Project
This was one of the most impactful projects I completed with my teammates during the DEPI program. It was an end-to-end data analysis project — from data selection and cleaning to visualization and dashboard design.<br> We were honored to be selected among the **Top 20** teams and invited to the DEPI Graduates Event, organized by Next Academy and the Ministry Of Communication, in recognition of our outstanding project work.

# Project Goal
**To practice real-world collaboration and apply all the data analysis steps:** <br>
1- Data cleaning <br>
2- Data transformation  <br>
3- Visualization  <br>
4- Team coordination and communication<br>

# Data Selection
Since the instructor didn’t specify a required dataset, we intentionally chose a messy, unorganized, and incomplete dataset. The goal was to challenge ourselves by applying every possible data cleaning and preparation technique we had learned.

# Tools Used 
**Excel**: Power Query, Power Pivot for cleaning and data modeling   <br>
**Python**: pandas, random libraries for exploration, preprocessing and fixing null values problem  <br>
**tablue:** For building insightful and visually appealing dashboards.  <br>

# Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with unstructured, real-world data  
- Strengthened collaboration skills in a team setting  
- Improved ability to choose the right tools for each stage of a data project  
- Learned to turn messy data into meaningful business insights
