# DEPI Graduation Project
One of the best projects i have worked on with my teammates in DEPI, the project is end-to-end since choosing the data until creating and coloring the dashboard

# Data Selection
since the instructor didn't soicify what the data should be like, so we choose the most dirty, unorgnized, and uncomplete dataset to apply all the cleaning methods on it

# Tools Used 
**Excel:** power query, power pivot
**python:** pandas, random liberries
**tablue:** visulazing and insights
